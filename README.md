## Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aemmadi/aemmadi/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

**I'm Nicolás López Rozo**, a Doctorate Candidate (3rd year) at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, in Cali (Colombia) 🌱 

👨🏽‍🎓 I earned a B.Sc. and a M.Sc. degree in Civil Engineering from the Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería Julio Garavito (Bogotá). My M.Sc. studies focused on water resources and the environment, and for my Thesis a distributed, process-based hydrological model was developed in Python (TACD2). In parallel to my MSc, I worked as a Full-time instructor (non-doctoral professor) in Hydraulics at Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería.

🔭 Currently, my research interests are algorithms and software engineering, more specifically on applications of computer science knowledge & techniques in different fields such as biology. My PhD thesis revolves around predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) using different levels of biological information ("omics" levels).
